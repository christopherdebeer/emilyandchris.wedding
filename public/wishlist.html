        <p>Some people have asked about a gift registry. We know that all of our guests have travelled for our wedding and some of you have travelled a very long way. We appreciate this so much, as the most important thing to us is that our friends and family are all together to celebrate. We REALLY REALLY do not want anyone to feel obliged to spend more money than they already have spent just to get to the wedding!</p>

        <p>If you would like to give a little something towards our future together, we have put together a gift registry with John Lewis, for anyone that would like to buy us something special for our home.x The gift list can be found on <a href="www.johnlewisgiftlist.com">www.johnlewisgiftlist.com</a> and our list number is 699545 (no password).</p>
