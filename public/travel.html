        <h2>Visa Requirements</h2>

        <p>All South African visitors to New Zealand will require visitor visas from the 21 November this year.</p>
        <p>Immigration NZ recommends that applicants apply for a visitor visa about six weeks in advance of their intended travel dates. There is a bit of administration involved in compiling evidence so please ensure you get organized to avoid disappointment. (mainly ours)</p>

        <h2>Getting to the venue</h2>
        <p>We are chartering a bus to collect guests from a central Mount Maunganui location, drive them to the venue and return them at the end of the evening. The venue is in a rural location and we want to ensure our guests arrive on time and return home safely so we encourage you to take this option. Please confirm if you would like to reserve a seat on the bus as seats are limited and we don’t want anyone left behind.</p>

        <h3>By Car</h3>
        <p>If you are driving, make sure you take a printed copy of travel directions with you as mobile coverage can be patchy in the area and some GPS will take you straight past it.</p>

        <h4>Easy Directions To Old Forest School from Tauranga/Mount Maunganui</h5>
        <p>The FAST option (about 10 minutes quicker than below), does have a $2 toll road though. You can pay the toll at 
        <a href="www.tollroad.govt.nz">www.tollroad.govt.nz</a> within 5 days after you’ve used it.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Head east on the Tauranga Eastern Link (the big new highway connecting Mount Maunganui and Paengaroa).</li>
          <li>When the Tauranga Eastern Link ends, at the Paengaroa roundabout, take the first exit on the left, heading towards Whakatane.</li>
          <li>You will go over a railway line and past the Te Puke golf course on your left.</li>
          <li>Turn right at Pongakawa Station Rd, (its the road after Pongakawa School Road on your right and Weallans Ground Spread on your left).</li>
          <li>Pongakawa Station Rd has a derelict old store on the corner.</li>
          <li>Old Forest School is approximately 13km from here.</li>
          <li>If you get to the BP you have just missed the turn off, back round you go…</li>
          <li>Pongakawa Station Rd ‘becomes’ Old Coach Rd and then Rotoehu Rd, so long as you keep to the median strip you will be fine.</li>
          <li>You will go over a one way bridge, head past lots of farms.</li>
          <li>You’ll pass an Old Forest School sign then go into the Rotoehu Forest.</li>
          <li>Look out for the fire station on your left, not far now…….we are on your left and have a sign out front and a blue letterbox.</li>
          
        </ol>

        <h4>The FREE option (about 10 minutes slower than above)</h4>
